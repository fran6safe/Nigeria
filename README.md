# 🇳🇬 Nigeria Population Analysis & Land Mass Visualization

This project explores the population distribution across Nigeria’s 37 states from 2006 to 2023 using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Microsoft Excel**.  
It highlights the relationship between **land mass**, **population growth**, and **urban vs. rural spread**, providing valuable insights for **urban planners**, **policy makers**, and **education & health sectors**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To provide a **visual and data-driven overview** of Nigeria’s population changes and land mass distribution using interactive dashboards.

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- **Lagos remains Nigeria’s most populated state**, followed by Kano and Kaduna.
- **FCT shows the highest population growth rate**, signaling rapid urbanization.
- **States with large land mass don’t always have large populations** (e.g., Niger).
- **Some states (e.g., Bayelsa, Ekiti)** have low population and growth, affecting policy attention.

## 💡 Value of This Analysis
- Useful for **policy formulation**, **infrastructure planning**, and **resource allocation**
- Helps identify population pressure zones and underdeveloped regions
- Provides a **foundation for projections and planning** in healthcare and education
